          <p> Cofetaria La Angela is a cafe/bakery is a outside the Sighi»ôoara citadel walls, about 150m east of the Tinsmith tower.
             I stopped in for a coffee break, my eyes drawn to the display case of pastries, cookies and exquisitely decorated cakes.
              My cappuccino was quickly whipped up by a smiling barista, and was hot and frothy from freshly-ground beans.
               I enjoyed it with a fruit tart, sitting outside at a table on the sidewalk.
                I thought prices were more reasonable than inside the citadel (about 10 lei for my snack) </p>
